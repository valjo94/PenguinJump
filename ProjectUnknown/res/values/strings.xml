    <string name="about_text">\n\n\nPenguin Jump is an interesting platform game game.
        The target of the game is to be funny, amusing and easy to play.\n
		The gameplay is very simple - you choose a stage and you navigate your penguin
		through the floors by tilting the phone left and right.\n Getting higher and higher,
		the blocks start moving faster and more enemies appear.\n
		Tell your friends about the game and compare your scores!
		This is my first game so don\'t judge me if you don\'t like it.
		I hope you have fun.\n\n
